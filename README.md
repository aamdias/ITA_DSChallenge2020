# ITA_DSChallenge2020

Data Science competition hold annualy by Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) - SJC, SP, Brazil

This year's focus would be predict when an aircraft will need maintenance, given data from sensors retrieved while each aircraft was flying. Data source available thanks to EMBRAER.

This repo is owned by Alan Dias and contains all the progress I myself had made during the competition, as well as my teamates'.

DISCLAIMER: The data used here is EMBRAER's private asset. That said, the folder containing the data used on the analysis is not tracked by git, i.e. is inside a .gitignore folder. If you wish to contribute to this project, contact me and I'll let you know if you can have access to the data.
